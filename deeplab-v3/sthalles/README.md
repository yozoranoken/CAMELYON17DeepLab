# DeepLab_V3 Image Semantic Segmentation Network

Implementation of the Semantic Segmentation DeepLab_V3 CNN as described in: https://arxiv.org/pdf/1606.00915.pdf

For a complete documentation of this implementation, check out the [blog post](https://sthalles.github.io/deep_segmentation_network/).

## Dependencies

- Python 3.x
- Numpy
- Tensorflow 1.4.0

## Downloads

Download the model checkpoints and dataset.
 
- [checkpoints](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/s7sx69pqjhrk0s4/AACXWCRd9JJ0zvcvDES9G3sba?dl=0)
- [dataset](https://mega.nz/#F!LlFCSaBB!1L_EoepUwhrHw4lHv1HRaA)

## Training and Eval

To train this model run:

```
python train.py --starting_learning_rate=0.00001 --batch_norm_decay=0.997 --gpu_id=0 --resnet_model=resnet_v2_50
```

Check out the *train.py* file for more input argument options. Each run produces a folder inside the *tboard_logs* directory (create it if not there).

To evaluate the model, run the *test.py* file passing to it the model_id parameter (the name of the folder created inside *tboard_logs* during training).

```
python test.py --model_id=16645
```

## Datasets

To create the dataset, first make sure you have the [Pascal VOC 2012](http://host.robots.ox.ac.uk/pascal/VOC/voc2012/) and the [Semantic Boundaries Dataset and Benchmark](http://home.bharathh.info/pubs/codes/SBD/download.html) datasets downloaded. 

After, head to ```dataset/``` and run the ```CreateTfRecord.ipynb``` notebook. The ```custom_train.txt``` file contains the name of the images selected for training. This file is designed to use the Pascal VOC 2012 set as a **TESTING** set. Therefore, it doesn't contain any images from the VOC 2012 val dataset. For more info, see the **Training** section of [Deeplab Image Semantic Segmentation Network](https://sthalles.github.io/deep_segmentation_network/).

Obs. You can skip that part and direct download the datasets used in this experiment - See the **Downloads** section

## Results
